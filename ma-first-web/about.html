                <br>how do you know that you are you?
                    Introduction is a lil bit complicated, i think. It is those first impressions you try to give of yourself that somehow concludes your whole self when you only give a fraction of it. And thats what im attempting to do, right here and then. (-phew)</p>
                <br>Hiiii. My name is Edelweis, people call me edel, some might call me 'ed' to keep it short. And as of today i am barely 19 years old. I was born and grew up in a small and chilly hometown named Ambarawa. Little did people know, my mom had to undergo several surgeries when she gave birth to me due to her having hypertension, and even fell unconscious for a few days. Thanks to my mom for battling with the hardship of pregnancy and such that Ive become the person i am today.</p>
                <br>To tell you the truth, growing up as a kid was fun and enjoyable — except the part where it wasnt hhh. You had a lot of friends from various background, you played along and laughed with them. Not a single day would've passed without having them around. Those are the good old days, i would say..</p>
                <br>Over the past few years, Ive made a lot friendships with many people that im proud calling them "my friends/ my people". High-school life was probably the most arduous and challenging chapter of life for me. You get betrayed, annoyed, frustrated even went through depression or some kind of existensial crisis, not knowing what to do or what you want, etc etc you were,, lost. I think we all experienced that in life, not knowing what will happen and getting those feeling of uncertainty because thats the beauty of life.
                 College life is whats coming next after high-school life ended. I really hope i could study as much as i could and i wish the best of luck for everyone!</p>
