                <h2>[HANDWRITTEN LETTERS & WHY THEY ARE CUTE]</h2>

                    There's a reason we talk about letters.
                    <br>There's a reason we keep letters.
                   <br>Maybe it's the doodles.
                    <br>Maybe it's the memories.
                    <br>But it all draws back to the bones of presence,
                    <br>how nothing feels so wonderful as knowing someone is thinking of you
                    <br>How a letter symbolizes that someone is paying attention to you 
                    <br>in a world that pummels us with thousands of directions to look in.
                    <br>There's something remarkable about just the thought of that.
                    <br>The thought of someone is sitting down for you and they manage 
                    <br>to tell you all the things that have ever mattered, in between the lines:
                    <br>"I care. <br>I think of you often. <br>You're more than just words on a screen to me."
